![example of running GO API](./screenshot/example.png)

# Learning Go ðŸ˜„
This repo contains code written as part of a learning exercise for [Go](https://golang.org/). 

The project focuses on a small book API written using [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) and [Gorm](https://gorm.io/). End points allow users to perform basic CRUD operations backed by a SQLite database. 

## Project Structure ðŸ“•
The API is broken up into three distinct parts:
1. `main.go` - Main package which kicks of the application. Routes and database setup are performed here. 
2. database - Contains functions and variables for interacting with the SQLite database via Gorm. 
3. book - Struct and handlers for reacting to incoming HTTP request.
